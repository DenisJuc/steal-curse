# Supernatural Relic Collector (Roblox)

An AFK-friendly supernatural relic collector. The game is built in small tested **slices**; this repo is currently at **Slice 0 - Foundation and passive scanning**.

Design sources (outside this repo): `Supernatural_Relic_Collector_GDD_FINAL.md`, `CURSOR_RELIC_GAME_BLUEPRINT.md`, `ROBLOX_GAME_PLAYBOOK.md`.

---

## 1. One-time setup

You only do this once per computer.

1. Install **Roblox Studio** and **Git**.
2. Install **Rokit** (the tool manager): https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit
3. Open a terminal (PowerShell) in this folder (`C:\steal-curse`) and run:
   ```
   rokit install
   wally install
   rojo plugin install
   ```
   - `rokit install` downloads the pinned tools: Rojo 7.7.0, Selene 0.31.0, Wally 0.3.2, Lune 0.10.4.
   - `wally install` downloads ProfileStore into `ServerPackages/` (used from Slice 2).
   - `rojo plugin install` adds the Rojo plugin to Roblox Studio. Restart Studio afterwards if it was open.

## 2. Build and open the game

1. In the terminal, in this folder:
   ```
   rojo build -o build/RelicCollector.rbxl
   ```
2. Open `build/RelicCollector.rbxl` in Roblox Studio (double-click it, or File > Open from File).

## 3. Live-sync code while you work (Rojo)

1. In the terminal run:
   ```
   rojo serve
   ```
   Leave this terminal open.
2. In Studio: **Plugins** tab > **Rojo** > click **Connect**.
3. Code changes now appear in Studio automatically.

If `default.project.json` changes (for example when new remotes are added), stop `rojo serve` (Ctrl+C), start it again, and click **Connect** again in Studio. You will be told when this is needed.

## 4. Play test

- Press **Play** (Home tab, or F5). The map is built by server code when the game starts.
- For 2 players: **Test** tab > **Clients and Servers** > set Players to **2** > **Start**. Close all test windows with **Cleanup** when done.
- Phone layout check: **Test** tab > **Device** (Device Emulator), pick a phone.
- Watch for errors: **View** tab > **Output**. Red text means an error.

Data is **in memory only** in Slice 0: everything resets when you stop Play. Saving arrives in Slice 2 (and needs the place published, see below).

## 5. Debug commands (Studio only)

Type these in the chat box during Play. They do not exist outside Studio.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/help` | Lists all debug commands in chat |
| `/roll [count]` | Runs instant extra scans, e.g. `/roll 50` (max 1000) |
| `/roll <tier>` | Gives one relic of that tier, e.g. `/roll cosmic` |
| `/scanspeed <seconds>` | Changes your scan interval, e.g. `/scanspeed 0.5`; `/scanspeed reset` restores 4 s |
| `/wipedata` | Resets your data |

## 6. Automated checks (run before every commit)

```
selene src
lune run tests/run
rojo build -o build/RelicCollector.rbxl
```

All three must finish with no errors and no warnings.

## 7. Project layout

```
default.project.json   Rojo mapping of src/ into the Roblox game tree; declares all remotes
src/shared/            ReplicatedStorage.Shared - config and pure math used by server, client and tests
  Config.luau            tunable numbers (scan interval, plots, feed, remote limits)
  RarityConfig.luau      the 8 rarity tiers and their base cumulative odds
  RelicConfig.luau       relic definitions (10 original placeholders in Slice 0)
  RollMath.luau          probability math: tier masses, per-relic odds, roll sampler
  Format.luau            number / odds formatting (1.5K, 1 in 1.32Qd)
src/server/            ServerScriptService.Server
  Main.server.luau       builds the map, then starts services in order
  DiscoveryPipeline.luau the single path every relic grant goes through
  DebugCommands.luau     Studio-only chat commands
  Services/              one module per system (Data, Plot, Roll, Scan, RemoteGuard, GameEvents)
  World/                 code-built map (BuildUtil, MapBuilder, PlotBuilder)
src/client/            StarterPlayerScripts.Client
  Main.client.luau       builds the UI
  UI/                    UIKit, HUD, DiscoveryFeed, Toasts
  StudioCommands.luau    Studio-only /help
tests/                 Lune headless tests (lune run tests/run)
```

## 8. How the systems work (Slice 0)

- **Server authority.** The server rolls every relic and owns all data. The client only displays results.
- **Passive scanner.** `ScanService` runs one loop for all players. Every 4 seconds (Config.Scan.BaseIntervalSeconds) each player gets exactly one relic. It never pauses for menus or effects. After a server hitch it grants at most 3 overdue scans.
- **Rolls.** `RollMath` uses the GDD tier odds (Uncommon+ 1 in 4 ... Cosmic 1 in 1.32 quadrillion). It climbs tier by tier, then picks a relic inside the tier by its weight. Each relic's displayed "1 in X" is computed from the same math.
- **Discovery pipeline.** Every grant goes through `DiscoveryPipeline.Grant`, which stores the relic and tells the owner's client. Later slices add Codex, auto-display, auto-sell and saving here.
- **Plots.** 8 shrine plots surround the hub. Each player gets the first free plot, their name appears on the gate sign, and they spawn there. **Set Max Players to 8 or fewer** when publishing.
- **UI.** The top-left panel shows the scan progress bar, interval, total scans and relics held (read from player attributes). The right-side feed shows each discovery with its tier color and base odds.

## 9. Publishing (needed from Slice 2 for saving)

1. File > **Publish to Roblox**, create a new experience.
2. Home > **Game Settings** > **Security** > turn on **Enable Studio Access to API Services** > Save.
3. Game Settings > **Places** (or Avatar/World settings) > set **Max Players** to 8 or fewer.
